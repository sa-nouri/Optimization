# Game Theory Implementations

This directory contains implementations of various game theory concepts and their applications. The implementations focus on both theoretical aspects and practical applications of game theory.

## Contents

### Nash Equilibrium
- `find_nash.ipynb`: Implementation of algorithms to find Nash equilibria in various game scenarios
- `q1.ipynb`: Solutions and implementations for specific game theory problems

## Structure

```

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed (see main README)
2. Open the Jupyter notebooks to explore the implementations
3. Run the examples to see the algorithms in action

## Future Additions

- Implementation of more game theory concepts
- Additional solution methods for finding equilibria
- Visualization tools for game theory problems
- More comprehensive test cases

## Game Theory

Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interactions among rational agents. It has applications in all fields of social science, as well as in logic, systems science and computer science
